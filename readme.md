# Overview


In this project, we explored deforestation data from the World Bank including forest area and total land area by region,
country and year from 1990 to 2016 to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from
successess. We joined separate tables for the global, regional and country data and created a view to facilitate exploration
and analysis across the combined data set.
